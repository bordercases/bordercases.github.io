  Prologue
  </h5>

  <p>
  I started writing this awhile back, mainly focusing on the idea of
  scale-free networks being the core driver of dividends on
  knowledge - and what to do about it if it were true. I've now included a bit more than
  that, mainly with the what to do about it part. Neural-network-as-metaphor serves as a useful basis for
  speculating on what prescriptive ways to think might be.
  Needless to say, this comes up a lot for me.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you're willing to bear a smidge of crackpottery, what is true in
  the following video covers much of the same conceptual ground that I
  would hope to. In particular, how fractal structures can come up
  through persistent accumulation and how this relates to neurons.

  The concepts written below are pretty core to my thinking and thus
  my writing. I'll be referencing this post often.

  "Knowledge is compound interest."[0]; "Knowledge is a percolation
  process."[1]; "Knowledge is a semantic web."[2]*: all three
  metaphors have (to my knowledge) been given independently; yet all
  reflect the same underlying model of there being exponential curve
  for returns on learning. A sign if there ever was one.

  <p>
  We can look at our perceptions of genius or stupidity as
  compressions or stretches on this curve: a multiplier effect on
  knowledge accumulation, which is already a multiplier of itself.

  <p>
  Exponential curves have their lopsided distribution of utility on the
  right. To see a genius is to see a person that appears to demonstrate knowledge and
  intelligence in a way which is more than exemplary, going beyond the
  class of its type. To say that knowledge "grows" is
  to involve an element of time; to define a genius is to say that
  someone is ahead of the curve, so to speak, in contrast to the typical
  population.
  </p>

  <p>
  Between "saving up money", "increasing p_bond", and "connecting
  concepts", what can we infer about genius if all it is, is the
  long-run accumulation process of knowledge?

  If you are reading this you are likely a neural network. Even if
  you're not human, I bet. Either way, you're going to obey the same
  principles. Connect early, connect often. Expend clock-cycles
  effectively; if you're human, spend energy wisely, and focus it on the correct part
  of the field of input. If you can have any notion of how to make
  concepts fit more effectively with each other, exploit it: reduce to
  principles, use a common language, put things side by side in space
  and time, optimize gestalts and algorithms separately,
  work through all the possibilities if you can find a way to keep
  track of them. Have perfect timing during your review and it will pay off in
  dividends. Exponentially, even.

  There will be those who will be built more effectively than you for
  the job. No matter. You do all you can when you can and you know
  you'll be living your life how it ought to be lived.

  * Note that semantic webs are examples of scale-free networks, and
  thus plug in to the concept of power-law growth; thus fitting the
  theme.
