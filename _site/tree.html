  <p>Ever wondered why we have so many different tree shapes? This guy covered on why trees are so tall:</p>

  <p>
  Essentially more sunlight upwards means that whoever is highest, wins.
  </p>
																							
  <p>
  But trees are old - deadly old. Even considering the <i>tabula rasa</i> that was the ice ages and other climate shifts, trees have had a long time to evolve. Why has evolution not yet made an optimal tree - instead of the diversity we find with cones, upside down cones, thin, wide etc? Even if we control for climate factors and look at just one local biosphere, you might see a dominance of one tree type, but even here in BC we see conifers thriving - mainly because of logging creating a monoculture during the replanting, more than rainforests not able to support a diversity of species.
  </p>

  <p>
  My guess is that unlike expanding vertically, where getting taller always wins, expanding horizontally <b>has no best dominant strategy</b>. For a tree competing for sunlight <b>horizontally</b>, any strategy potentially has payoff; thus, you can squeeze into any ecological niche where you can. There are many non-dominant strategy games, but the one that comes to mind is the simplest: Colonel Blotto. It only takes seven minutes to get hip, so watch the video below.

  <p>
  As a quick summary: in Colonel Blotto, you are given a finite amount of troops, and you allocate your troops across three fronts.
  Two players take turns allocating, and whoever has the   highest number of troops on a front, takes the front. If you have more fronts won,
  you win. It's dead simple in principle, but quickly you discover that any allocation has an allocation that beats it. As the video explains,
  no strategy is the best strategy, and your dominant meta-strategy would be to mix it up as you need to.
  </p>

  <p>
If I was a tree that aspired for his tree-family to become the One Tree Species to Rule Them All, how wide I spread out to starve other trees of sunlight is a vertical Colonel Blotto, played through time. Instead of troops I have branches of leaves (limited space and metabolic energy means I can only have so many branches, controlling for height). Every front is a notch of height for the tree - and in a slight twist, if I have more troops/branches in an adjacent front, I take the lower front, because I'm preventing trees from having sunlight and overtaking them.
  </p>

<p>Allocating most of my hundred branches of leaves to grow at the bottom means that I can kill off my opponent's young early; any young tree would be starved for sunlight if it grew under a wide tree branch. However, it also limits the number of leaves I can put on higher branches, in higher fronts: I don't want to cover my own branches below me as that is inefficient. So I become cone shaped. That leaves me vulnerable to exploits of taller trees that are umbrella shaped, thus starving me quickly; however umbrella shaped trees are all long-game because they can only put their leaves near the top and still be efficient. Hence we see the duality of conic-shaped trees, that win early but lose late, and umbrellas, that win late and lose early.</p>

<p>An even distribution of leaves that wouldn't starve itself would have to find a way of having multiple levels of branches without any level covering the other. We see this - there are trees that have branches that go out slightly and then twist upwards, and they are very thin. This gives more per-unit solar coverage; however, close-packing with this kind of coverage could starve trees between themselves. Still, these trees would survive early growth from wide trees because they could take sunlight in from multiple angles.</p>

<p>I have a big motherfuckin' conifer outside of my window that puts mixed strategies inside of mixed strategies. It is tall and conic, and has a more even allocation of branches than other conics because it twists its branches up. Trees are beautiful and nature is tooth-and-claw, even for the maternalistic parts. Remember that.</p>
