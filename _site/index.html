  After years of bad generalization, I guess I've finally decided to
  kick the habit. I am distinterested or at least should be disinterested in the
  average. Boundary cases cover all our expectations, asserting that we
  are not caught off guard. Fringes are dual, threatening to surprise us
  and challaenge our preconceptions. At some point I woke up in the morning,
  thinking to myself how being an outlier - beating the averages - has
  become the only safe game in town.

  Border cases, all of them. I write this blog because I want to know,
  act like, and be one of the outliers.
