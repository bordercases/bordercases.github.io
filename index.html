Welcome to Border Cases.
</p>

<p>
After years of a bad generalization habit, I guess I've finally decided to
kick. I am distinterested or at least should be disinterested in the
average. Boundary cases cover all our expectations, assuring that we
are not caught off guard. Fringes are dual, assuring us of our
surpise and threatening our preconceptions. And at some point I woke up in the morning,
thinking to myself how being an outlier - beating the averages - has
become the only safe game in town.
</p>

<p>Border cases, all of them. This blog I write because I want to know
and be one of the outliers.</p>
